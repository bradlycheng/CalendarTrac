CalendarTrac

Scavengered my files from my old unorganized college laptop that had CalendarTrac source code.
My calendartrac.com renewal ended and they wiped my data.
Uploaded what I can to Github.

Uses Curl https://github.com/curl/curl to do fetch from JSON from API sites
JSON parsed data to mySQL database
The bootstrap calendar uses mySQL database with SQL queries based on users selected topics.

the all.php will gather all the JSON parsed data from all my different API sources and update the mySQL database.

Started October 2018. Up and Running in November 2018. Stop renewal February 2019 (started new job).
